# Real data from the paper "A Probabilistic Approach to Blood Glucose Prediction in Type 1 Diabetes under Meal Uncertainties"
This repository contains data from six individuals with type 1 diabetes that participated in a clinical trial performed at the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile. The study lasted seven days for each person and implied the ambulatory use of a continuous glucose monitor (Medtronic’s Guardian Sensor 3) and an insulin pump. Automatic insulin infusion, insulin bolus, and consumed carbohydrates were directly extracted from the pump report. The study was conducted under normal daily activities, i.e., individuals did not have a controlled scheme of carbohydrate intake or physical activity.

Each file contains the following measurements (T = 5min): 
1. CGM [mg/dL]
2. Bolus Insulin [U]
3. Basal Insulin [u/h]
4. Carbohydrates [g]
